# PHP-Vehicle_parking_system
This is a simple Vehicle parking management system.
In this project I used HTML,CSS,PHP and SQL for backend. Also WAMP server is used to run this project.
I used different graphical charts to represent the different vehicles and check IN/OUT of them.

++++Also used some filters for validating the vehicle numbers and valid entries can be inserted.++++
